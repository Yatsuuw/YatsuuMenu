Minecraft plug-in running on Spigot or Paper servers to give the player a nether star. Once the nether star is clicked, an interface opens with a block of grass. When the grass block is clicked, the player is teleported to another server linked to the BungeeCord or Velocity network.
The server can be customized in the “config.yml” file. The plugin teleports the player to the server with the same name in the configuration file and the name given to it in the network.
